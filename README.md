# Regression-Models

Welcome to the **Regression Models Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for various regression models, covering multiple types and techniques for data analysis and machine learning.

## 📚 Overview

Regression analysis is a fundamental tool in statistics and machine learning that helps model and analyze the relationships between variables. This repository includes implementations of different regression techniques, each suitable for different types of data and objectives.

## 🧠 Types of Regression Models

The repository contains code implementations of the following types of regression:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple model that assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
2. **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by considering higher-degree polynomial terms for better fitting of non-linear data.
3. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**: Introduces regularization to penalize large coefficients, preventing overfitting.
4. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**: Similar to Ridge, but applies an L1 penalty, leading to sparsity and feature selection.
5. **Elastic Net Regression**: Combines L1 and L2 regularization for balanced feature selection and model fitting.
6. **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems by modeling the probability of class membership.
7. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Uses support vector machines for regression, effective for non-linear data.
8. **Decision Tree Regression**: Non-parametric model that makes predictions by splitting the data based on feature values.
9. **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their outputs.
10. **Gradient Boosting Regression**: Another ensemble method that combines the predictions of several weak learners (decision trees).
11. **Bayesian Regression**: Incorporates Bayesian principles to estimate distributions of parameters rather than point estimates.
